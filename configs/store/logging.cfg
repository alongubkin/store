"Logging" 
{
	// Toggles logging to sourcemod/logs/store <date>.log
	// "0" = no logging
	// "1" = errors only
	// "2" = errors and warnings
	// "3" = errors, warnings and info
	// "4" = errors, warnings, info and debug
	// "5" = errors, warnings, info, debug and trace
	// Default: "2"
	"log_level"         "2"

	// Toggles what types of logs are flushed immediately to disk (same types as defined in
	// "log_level" above). In case of a server crash, the last few log lines that weren't flushed
	// will be lost. On the other hand, flushing every single line under heavy load may impact I/O
	// performance. This should only become an issue when running 20+ servers with full trace logs
	// (level 5).
	// Default: "2" (errors and warnings)
	"log_flush_level"   "2"

	// Toggles whether errors are logged to Sourcemod's error log in addition to the Store's log file,
	// assuming "log_level" (above) is set to "1" or more.
	// Default: "1"
	"log_errors_to_SM"  "1"
